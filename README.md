# Login App with Flutter using NodeJs, Sequelize, HttpRequest, Express, BCrypt, Jwt and much more!

This code is a simply test of comunication between Flutter and a Node server.

-You need to create an empty local database and a user with previleges and you can insert your database name and username into **server/development.env** as **MYSQL_URI**

-After that, you can go to **/server** and run **npm run reset**, that insert into your database all the seed placed in **/server/database/seed.js**

-Now you have a running server on your localhost!

-You can also use **npm run watch** for live refresh with nodemon and without insert all the seeds in your database.

-Now build your app, go to the settings page and set the **IP** of the computer that run the server. (You can see it with **ipconfig** on Windows or **ifconfig** on Linux).

-Now you can test the app. Go to register, create a new user and login. 

Have fun! :)
